# Image Steganography
## Overview
Image steganography is a GUI-based project in which we are hiding a secret message within the image using encoding and decoding functions. We are creating a window in which there are two buttons: encoding and decoding.

For encoding, select any image, this image will be converted into png format. Type message in the message box then it will convert into base64, merge this encoded string into image and the user can save the image where he/she wants.

For decoding, select the image which is encoded, the base64 string will get separated by decoding, and by Tkinter module hidden text is shown in the textbox.
